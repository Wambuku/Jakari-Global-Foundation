          Persons with disabilities often face barriers in accessing quality healthcare. Jakari Global is committed to eliminating these barriers through advocacy, inclusive program design, and collaborations that ensure equitable health services.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Our approach includes training health workers on disability inclusion, improving facility accessibility, and providing assistive devices where needed. We work hand-in-hand with local health facilities to create **disability-friendly environments** that prioritize dignity, respect, and autonomy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          In partnership with community-based organizations, we have launched the **Access for All Initiative**, focusing on raising awareness about the healthcare rights of persons with disabilities. This involves capacity-building workshops for caregivers, healthcare providers, and policy influencers to ensure holistic support systems.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          One impactful intervention has been the establishment of **Mobile Health Camps** specifically tailored for people with mobility, visual, and hearing impairments. These camps provide screenings, primary healthcare services, and referrals — all in accessible formats.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Success stories from these initiatives highlight individuals who, after years of exclusion, have finally received essential treatments, prosthetics, or therapy services. These stories not only affirm the right to health but also inspire broader community inclusion efforts.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Additionally, Jakari Global advocates for the **integration of sign language interpreters**, Braille materials, and disability-friendly telehealth platforms to further reduce communication barriers within healthcare delivery.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Looking ahead, our focus is to establish **Community Health Champions with Disabilities**, empowering them to lead peer-support groups, engage in health education outreach, and serve as ambassadors for inclusive healthcare practices in their regions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          At the core of our mission is the belief that healthcare is a universal right. Through intentional design, empathy, and collaboration, we are working towards a future where no one is left behind due to disability.
        </p>
