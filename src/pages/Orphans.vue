          What we must not forget is that every statistic is a lifeâ€”a child in need of a family, love, and, most importantly, basic health services.

              We have allocated around $3,000 specifically for the HIV/AIDS program, aimed at rooting out one of the causes of children becoming orphaned in specific regions. By 2020, we performed HIV tests on all orphan children registered in our database and provided medical assistance and sensitization to the community. We aim to raise more funds to provide ongoing health services and support to the community.
